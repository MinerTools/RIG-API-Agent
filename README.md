# API-Agent - Mining RIG Monitoring

Local API designed for MTools to send needed informations to monitor RIG (supports Phoenix Miner (maybe out of date) and mainly GMiner)

This API collects mining/windows/RIG information and sends it to MTools server with an unique ID (must be accepted on the server to work)
